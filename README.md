### Simple grid world Markov Decision Process
*** 

#####
In a simple **Grid World**, agent can move left, right, up and down, permited that he stays within the board. Each action yield reward of -1, and reaching the goal state brings rewards the agent with number of points equal to the Manhattan distance from starting to the goal field. 

Using the value iteration algorithm, state value function was estimated, and optimal policy visualized.

Additionally, **reward shaping** was used to improve agent's behaviour.
